        <p>In baking creativity, process and attention to detail yield edible works of art. I'm learning to apply the same principles that brought me success in the kitchen towards a career in web development. Focused on learning the front end of things at the moment with the eventual goal of becoming a full stack engineer</p>
        <p>I'm a problem solver and hands on learner, the kid who took apart Mom's appliances to see how they worked type. What I'm getting at is my whole life has been guided by "I don't Know, but I bet I can figure it out" philosophy.</p>
        <p>When I'm not in the kitchen or learning code I can usually be found writing and performing with my band, wandering around with a camera or hiking. Currently living in Sterling, VA with my wife, 2 kids, 3 dogs and a hermit crab. </p>
        <p id="ps">*before you ask, it's bread. my favorite thing to bake is bread. hire me, i make great snacks</p>
